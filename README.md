# InternalRazorPagesUi
.Net Razor Pages is extremly efficient for building internal ui applications that doesn't require heavy use of javascript for fluent interactivity, and can rely on simple serverside rendering in the beginning while remaining open for extension by adding more javascript as the application matures.

This application is intended as a simple template used for building internal applications.
